We have 2 types of cells: Virus and Doctor
We added some rules for them: 
	a) If Virus is near the Doctor, then Doctor will neutralize it and will transfer to it's position.
	b) If a Doctor is between 4 virus cells, he will die

Environment:
	a) Cemetery - any cell dies (for obv. reasons)
	c) Regeneration - is an environment where the reproduction is working faster.

Every object that appears is instantiated randomly.

Using Up Arrow or Down Arrow key you can control the generation interval (increase it of decrease it respectively). Also, the total number of present life beings is provided there.
